              <p>
                Review process in Vision & Quest International Journal of Science Technology and Management (VQIJSTM) is a double blind process and the editors monitor it very closely so that original and quality research papers are published. The quality of the research papers is meticulously assessed by the editors before it is sent for reviewing. Manuscripts that do not meet the desired scientific standards are not considered for the reviewing process. It is expected from the authors to pay serious attention towards the instructions mandated and to ensure that their papers meet the required standards for publication of the article. If the submitted papers do not fulfil the parameters such as readability, relevancy of the content and grammatical usage etc., editors may direct the author(s) for resubmission.
              </p>
              <p>
                The editors would get in touch with the referees as soon as they receive the papers and keep reminding periodically about the due date of submission of the paper after the completion of the review process. The reviewers invest their precious time and make necessary and vital contribution to the scientific processes of the research article.
              </p>
              <p>
                Authors can have a different opinion than of the reviewers, and may give proper justification of their work and further submitted the research paper to the editor for reconsideration and for publication in the journal. Further the editor can send the justification of authors to the referee. Any offensive remarks made against the reviewerâ€™s judgements/ comments, would lead to the cancellation of publication of the research paper.
              </p>
              <p>
                The editorial assessment process is conducted once again after the completion of the referee process, before the final version of the paper is recommended for publication in the journal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire process of reviewing articles that are submitted to VQIJSTM is conducted online and is digitally processed. The authors are required to submit their manuscript online and in case of any difficulty in the process of submission of their manuscript, the author (s) are required to contact the editor, via email.
