              <p><strong>Contribution to Editorial Decisions:</strong> Peer review assists Editor-in-Chief/Editor and the Editorial Board in making editorial decisions and editorial communications with the authors regarding any query or improvement of the paper. VQIJSTM reviewers work for the journal on a volunteer basis.</p>

              <p>The decisions of the Editorial Board include acceptance of research paper, acceptance of paper with revisions, revised resubmission, or rejection. Articles that are poorly written or found to be disorganized and do not meet the prescribed standards of the journal would be rejected. In such conditions, the authors would be directed by the editorial board to update and resubmit their research paper, the acceptance of the revised submission is not guaranteed. Rejected articles will not be re-reviewed. Articles can be rejected without being reviewed if the Editor-in-Chief/Editor deems the article not suitable for publication.</p>

              <p>Promptness: If a reviewer feels that the received manuscript does not suite the area of his/her specialization and as a result of which the reviewing process will suffer, he/she needs to notify the matter to the editor.</p>

              <p>All reviews should be conveyed to the editorial board in the prescribed time.

              <p>The reviewing process should be objective and unbiased. The reviewers should argue their statements logically and must abstain from personal criticism.</p>

              <p>The reviewers must utilize the review form that would be provided by the editors along with the submitted article. If the reviewers agree, then their names would be published in the list of former reviewers of the journal, when the reviewers give their consent to do a review of the research article.</p>

              <p>In case the answers from previous reviewers are insufficient, inappropriate or do not reach the editor in the prescribed time frame, the editorial board reserves the right to resend a manuscript to additional reviewers.</p>

              <p><strong>Standards of Objectivity:</strong> Reviews should be conducted objectively. Personal criticism of the author is not acceptable. Referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.</p>

              <p><strong>Acknowledgement of Sources:</strong> Reviewers should identify the published work that has not been cited by the authors. Relevant citation should be mentioned in case if any result or argument has been previously reported. A reviewer should inform the editorial board and draw their attention to any substantial similarity of the received manuscript and any other published paper, of which the reviewer has a personal knowledge.</p>

              <p><strong>Interest conflict:</strong> One must make sure that the information or ideas which are derived via peer review are kept confidential. Reviewers must not consider the manuscripts that would generate conflicts of interest, are a consequence of collaborative, competitive or some other form of relationships, which may have certain connections with the authors/ institutions/ companies that are connected to publish papers.</p>
